# Eniac Market Expansion Analysis
SQL-based analysis of potential partnership with Brazilian e-commerce logistics provider

## Summary
In this project, I evaluated the potential expansion of Eniac, an Apple-compatible accessories marketplace, into the Brazilian market. I explored possible partnerships to accelerate entry given the company’s need to scale and preserve its customer-centric approach. The project scope is to assess the Brazilian e-commerce market, evaluate Magist as a potential partner, and to deliver data-driven recommendations to the leadership of Eniac. A recommendation is made not to partner with Magist due to its operational challenges and risks, and that an alternative strategy should be considered to ensure a successful market entry.

## Project Overview
In fall 2018, Eniac, a European e-commerce marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories was evaluating a strategic expansion into the Brazilian market. The proposed partnership with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company providing order management and logistics services to local e-commerce vendors, required thorough data analysis to assess viability.

This project analyzes Magist's operational database to evaluate two critical factors:
  1.	Partnership Compatibility: Whether Magist's marketplace ecosystem aligns with Eniac's premium product catalog
  2.	Service Quality: Whether Magist's delivery performance meets Eniac's customer satisfaction standards

## Business Objectives
  •	Analyze product categories and delivery performance metrics from Magist's database
  •	Evaluate compatibility between Magist's vendor ecosystem and Eniac's premium tech products
  •	Assess delivery speed and reliability against Eniac's customer satisfaction requirements
  •	Provide data-driven recommendations for the proposed 3-year partnership

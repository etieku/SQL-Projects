# SQL Business Exploration

## Summary
In this project, I evaluated the potential expansion of Eniac, an Apple-compatible accessories marketplace, into the Brazilian market. I explored possible partnerships to accelerate entry given the company’s need to scale and preserve its customer-centric approach. The project scope is to assess the Brazilian e-commerce market, evaluate Magist as a potential partner, and to deliver data-driven recommendations to the leadership of Eniac. A recommendation is made not to partner with Magist due to its operational challenges and risks, and that an alternative strategy should be considered to ensure a successful market entry.
